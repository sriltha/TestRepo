The system will utilize the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java as the core library for all LDAP operations, connection management, and secure communication.

LDAP Connection Management (Multiple URLs): 
The system uses the UnboundID LDAP SDK's ServerSet to manage and connect to a list of multiple LDAP server URLs for high availability.

TTL Configuration: 
Each cached LDAP entry will be associated with a configurable Time-To-Live (TTL) value, defining when the entry expires and requires a fresh lookup.

Failover Logic: 
Connections will be attempted sequentially, using a specified retry mechanism and intelligent health checks to ensure continuous server availability

LDAP ResultCode Handling: 
The system must specify handling logic for critical LDAP ResultCode exceptions, such as NO_SUCH_OBJECT, INVALID_CREDENTIALS, and connection errors.

Logging Integration: 
Integrate with a logging framework (e.g., SLF4J/Log4j) to capture critical operational events, including connection failures, failover events, and cache activity.
